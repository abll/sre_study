# Reliably Engineering at Sites...

I recently accepted a position as a SRE engineer. When i first entered the tech industry i was a developer and fell in love with the cloud. I have spent the last 3 years working as a cloud engineer. It was a great experience as it really introduced me to the traditional "Ops" side of the house. It was a chance for me to explore the different layers of technology. What does it mean to be an EC2 sending a packet to an S3 bucket while being authenticated by an attached IAM role. 

As i being the transition to a new role i want to take the time to study some topics that i have let fall by the wayside as i have been so focused on wrangling the beast that is AWS. And to apply all the lessons i have learned in the cloud to reliably (whatever that means) engineering at sites. 

Doing this with readme's and GIT will force me to get back into the habit of using GIT for everything and to get more experience documenting things.
