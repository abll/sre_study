# GIT and stuff

So I hear that GIT is kind of important for these SRE types. So i will attempt to figure out what GIT is, how it works and i guess more importantly how i need to use it. 

But on a real note GIT has been something that i have been using off and on since college. But i have never take the time to really dive deep and make sure i had a good understanding of GIT. I think that between Github, IDEs and what not i have been doing GIT lite for years

So hopefully this journey is fruitful and by the end of this i will be a super charged GIT enabled SRE or all the other abbreviations.
